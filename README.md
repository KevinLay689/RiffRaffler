# RiffRaffler

Online raffles are notoriously known to be untrusted. YouTube giveaways frequently involve giving the prize away to a friend and this makes it unfair for everyone else involved. RiffRaffler is an android application that makes raffling fair to everyone. I published the code so that everyone can be assured that it is completely fair to raffle with RiffRaffler.
